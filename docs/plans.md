# Things to do

- [x] move player around maze
- [x] player collide with walls
- [x] define some polyominos
- [x] spawn random polyomino
- [x] polyomino movement and rotation
- [x] polyomino-level collision
- [x] freeze polyomino to background
- [x] polyomino-player collision
- [x] switch controls between player and polyomino
- [x] remove lines (can we restore walls? should we?)
- [x] mino's hunger + food
- [x] buffered input (if player press up while moving right, it takes effect after the movement finishes
      - held button works just fine, it seems :)
- [x] place blocks to earn food
- [x] what happens when polyomino won't fit?
      - if it won't fit it will just stay over there
      - player is motivated to find a place for it because it earns food
- [x] experiment smaller height so polyomino is visible when spawning
- [x] scoring
- [x] music
   - [x] try putting most of ggsound on its own bank?
- [x] title screen

- [x] better controls
      - i'm thinking any {A,B,Sel,Start} goes from player to polyomino
      - then {Sel,Start} goes from polyomino to player
      - also, held only keeps moving, doesn't start movement - so placing polyomino doesn't move player
- [x] remeber to set prio flag on RIP metasprite
     - and to remove any from Ghost
- [x] sound
- [x] balance polyomino probabilities (otherwise the more symmetrical, the less likely to show up)
- [x] balance hunger/nutrition
- [x] instructions (both for NES and itch.io)
- [x] sprite shuffling, at least for fruits <-- important now bc of 4-width pieces
- [x] high scores
- [x] score for blocks and lines
- [ ] fix help text (more options available to switch)
- [ ] web build (ninjapad)
- [ ] alt mode (drop blocks)
- [ ] credits (mention zx origin page)
- [ ] spawn polyomino on a viable column
- [ ] random polish
- [ ] expire old fruits
- [ ] predefined mazes? only if we have time
- [ ] automino mode?
- [ ] power ups?
- [?] irregular polyominos? (e.g. 3 blocks in a diagonal)
- [?] 8x16 mode?
      - premature optimization?
        fruits renderer takes 4k cycles, but 8x16 fruits still take 2.8k
      - also it looks nices with the priority flag on the bottom half of the player
- [?] what happens when it overlaps the player? lock player for a bit? kill them?
      - i think it's fine as it is; player has already too much on their plate
