# Things to do - postjam
- [o] better polyomino controls
      - up for hard drop
      - down for soft drop
      - hold left/right repeat movement
- [ ] better instructions? (remove multiple buttons for minotaur side)
- [ ] spawn polyomino on a viable column
- [ ] next pieces
- [ ] bag of pieces
- [ ] random polish
- [ ] expire old fruits
- [ ] predefined mazes?
- [ ] automino mode? (minotaur moving by themselves)
- [ ] power ups?
- [?] irregular polyominos? (e.g. 3 blocks in a diagonal)
